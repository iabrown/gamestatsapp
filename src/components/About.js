          <p><strong>In 2011 I graduated high school</strong> and began attending California Baptist University (CBU) in Riverside, CA to study Graphic Design and Digital Media. While attending University I began working in Information Technology (IT) in 2011 which lead to full-time employment in 2014 as a Client Support Specialist where I worked with merchants to provide them the technical expertise they needed to for setting up credit card transactions along with any assistance needed moving forward. </p>

          <p><strong>In November 2017, </strong>I was able to transition into the SRG General Contractor construction division where I began working as Project Engineer in Multi-Family Construction. Here I was able to coordinate and work with a wide range of companies to design and build our projects. Coordinating with the building development teams that consisted of Civil Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Structural Engineers, Architectural Engineers, Interior Designers, and along with City Inspectors and Building Departments. As the Project Engineer I worked alongside with the Assistant Project Manager and Project Managers to provide support to our Superintendents and their field team members within our company and also coordinated with the Sub-Contractors on each of the building projects. The sub-contractors consisted of a wide variety of disciplines including: landscaping, civil, plumbing, electrical, painting, concrete, wood framers, structural steel, finish steel, flooring, artwork, millwork, tiling, appliance vendors, and many more individual trades.</p>
